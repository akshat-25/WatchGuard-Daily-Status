// The difference between PUBLIC and INTERNAL is that 
// if we have 2 projects and we have a cltass with 'internal' in 1st project 
// and then if we give reference of this project to the second project 
// then it is not accessible but if it were 'public' then it would have been accessible by giving refernence.
